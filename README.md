If you have HP Dell whatever you will see a Type here to search Put in %appdata% copy and paste that if you can then once it opens you will see ap bar saying appdata Roaming etc... Press appdata then go to Local then scrolldown a little and you will see Fallout Shelter
click on that and you will see Vault1,2,3 take out the third one put it in the recycling or move it on to your desktop by dragging and dropping whatever but remove Vault3.sav and place it with this Vault3.sav And reload Fallout Shelter and if you did it right it will say Enter vault 777 if you can comment on this tell me what to change like weapons stuff like that also... This is for Steam and Bethesda.net versions
